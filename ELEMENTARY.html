		<h2 >ELEMENTARY DAYS </h2>
<br>
<br>		
		<p id="pag1"> I started elementary at <b>ZAPATERA ELEMENTARY SCHOOL</b> 
		Elementary school days were enjoyable for me because they weren't stressful
	    like high school, where you worried about what your teacher would say or what you
	    needed to learn. Instead, they were more like learning processes, where you went
	    to school, had fun, learned something, and that was it. one time, a classmate of mine 
	    teased me about having the last name ASID, and I became upset. From that point on, 
	    she would always refer to me as ASIDO.I was so enraged at him at this point that all
	    I did in in our school was write on his uniform with a ballpen.thats what i experience
	    my elementary days happy yet sad because so many people bulled me at that time.</p>
