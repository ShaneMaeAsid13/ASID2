	    <h2> SENIOR HIGH SCHOOL DAYS </h2> 
<br>
 		<p id="pag1">I started senior high at <b>ACT</b> as a senior in high school, it was an incredible honor and the best journey I had ever been on. I never thought I would be attending a prestigious university with top-notch academics. I had fantastic professors and a lot of friends at this school. and I learned a lot of lessons and things in this school. When I joined in this college, I had no idea that I would be fortunate since I had better myself and let others notice my skills and abilities. We also acquired the requisite knowledge and maturity in every subject. I was ecstatic to be sent to a fantastic school where my classmates, fellow students, and teachers were all wonderful people. I had to mention this Kind people that accepted me for who I am were all around me. I consider myself tremendously fortunate and blessed to have a family like mine. We support one another because we are one in our adoration and care for one another.</p>
