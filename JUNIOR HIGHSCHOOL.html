     	  	<h2>JUNIORHIGH SHOOL DAYS </h2> 
<br>  	
	  	<p id="pag1"> I started high school at <b>ZAPATERA NATIONAL HIGH SCHOOL</b>There are many memories related with high school that I had attended Zapatera National High School.Bad memories, gaffes, lessons, happiness, drama, heartbreak, tragedy, and, most significantly, good ones come to mind.Only a few of them are enjoyable. High school seems to have passed by wonderfully swiftly, sometimes nearly too quickly. Along with creating friends for life,I learned a great deal of priceless life lessons. I learned the value of tenacity and resolve, as well as how to tell genuine friends from imposters. It was challenging, but it was also a lovely experience that I will soon miss. 
<br>
	   My memories of high school include some pleasant ones, others were unfavorable. My close friends are involved in most of my happy memories.My high school life was wonderful because of my friends because they are still there in my college and haven't abandoned me despite not attending the same school.</p>
